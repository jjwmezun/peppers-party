# Pepper's Party

Some dumb, simply game programmed in C & SDL2 -- mainly as a 'scuse to practice programming in C.

Idea based ( stolen ) on some obscure puzzle game called "Peggy's Party" from some obscure game collection called "Galaxy Games for Girls".


## Progress

So far I've completed all o' the basic game mechanics, including all object interactions & a rudimentary victory screen.

Graphics are all intentionally lazy prototypes, not intended for the final version.


## What remains:

* Level states, such as level-select, instructions, & a victory screen that takes the player back to the level-select.
* Multiple levels.
* A way to save levels completed.
* Better graphics.
